The solution to one of the questions put forward by my YouTube follower, 
Joseph from University of Manitoba, Canada

Question by Joseph, Code by Surya Penmetsa
The flight path of a model rocket with mass 0.1 kg. During the first
T(inital) 0.015 seconds, the rocket is propelled forward by the rocket
engine with a force of 16N. The rocket then flies up while slowing down
under teh force of gravity once the engine is switched off at T(inital)
seconds. After the rocket reaches its apex, it starts to fall back down.
When its forward velocity reaches 20 m/s the parachute opens (assumed to
be opend instantly) and the rocket continues to drop at a constant
velocity of 20m/s until it hits the ground.
Create a MATLAB script that determines and plots the (height against
time) abd (velocity against time) of the model rocket as a function of
time of flight.
Repeat the experiment for T(initial) = 0.1, 0.3

Here's the code Joseph, hope it helps. :)
